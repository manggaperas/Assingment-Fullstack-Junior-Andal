# Assingment-Fullstack-Junior-Andal

I started by writing C# code, and then I used the OOP approach to translate it to Javascript.
The code that I give to https://jsfiddle.net/manggaperas/ro6kt2vf/40/ could change in certain places.
More than only Index.html, Main.Js, and Style.css were altered in the file's input and separation.
